# Preliminaries 

## Attributions

This seminar was developed by [Eric Chu](https://github.com/echu113) with seminar materials previously designed by Gloria Li and Alice Zh and contains excerpts from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. It was later modified by Keegan Korthauer.

# Part 1: First time ggplot-ing

Open a new .Rmd file. This is where we will work on ggplot2. 

>"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." — John Tukey

This chapter will teach you how to visualise your data using ggplot2. R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.

First, we load tidyverse, which includes ggplot2. It also includes several packages which are useful in most any data analysis.

```{r load_tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

The output of loading the tidyverse tells you which functions from the tidyverse conflict with functions in base R (or from other packages you might have loaded). If you call any of these functions, it's safest to call them with their `package::function()` prefix to tell R which version of the function to use. For example, `ggplot2::ggplot()` tells R explicitly that we're using the ggplot() function from the ggplot2 package.

If you run this code and get the error message “there is no package called ‘tidyverse’”, you’ll need to first install it, then run library() once again.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# not run
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session. See [Packages required] for some additional help.


## The mpg data frame

Let's use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?

You can test your answer with the mpg data frame found in ggplot2 (aka `ggplot2::mpg`). A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). `mpg` contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

Let's see what the mpg data frame looks like: 

```{r mpg}
mpg
```

Among the variables in mpg are:

* `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

* `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

To learn about the other variables in `mpg`, open its help page by running `?mpg`.

### Creating a ggplot

To create a plot using these two variables in `mpg`, run this code to put `displ` on the x-axis and `hwy` on the y-axis:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (`displ`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?

With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`. `ggplot()` creates a coordinate system that you can add **layers** to. The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph. So `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.

You build your graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`. The function `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. The ggplot2 package comes with many "geom" functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this seminar.

Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The mapping argument is always paired with `aes()`, and the x and y arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variable in the data argument, in this case, `mpg`.

## Your first (bare-bones) graphing template

Let’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with ggplot2. To make a graph, we can replace the bracketed sections in the following code template with a dataset, a geom function, and a collection of mappings. The rest of this seminar will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# code template
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

The rest of this seminar will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. We will begin with the `<MAPPINGS>` component. 

## Exercise

Take 5 minutes to create a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Aesthetic mappings 

In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(mpg, displ > 5, hwy > 20), colour = "red", size = 2.2)
```


Let’s hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the `class` value for each car. The `class` variable of the `mpg` dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).

You can add a third variable, like `class`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an **aesthetic**. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word "level" to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:

```{r, echo = FALSE, asp = 1/4}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(1, 1), size = 20) +
  geom_point(aes(2, 1), size = 10) + 
  geom_point(aes(3, 1), size = 20, shape = 17) + 
  geom_point(aes(4, 1), size = 20, colour = "blue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.5, 4.5), labels = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.9, 1.1), labels = NULL) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/3)
```


You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

(ggplot2 allows British and American English spellings, e.g. colour or color.)

To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside `aes()`. ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.

The colors reveal that many of the unusual points are two-seater cars. These cars don’t seem like hybrids, and are, in fact, sports cars! Sports cars have large engines like SUVs and pickup trucks, but small bodies like midsize and compact cars, which improves their gas mileage. In hindsight, these cars were unlikely to be hybrids since they have large engines.

In the above example, we mapped class to the color aesthetic, but we could have mapped class to the size aesthetic in the same way. In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. We get a **warning** here, because mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea.


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```


For each aesthetic, you use `aes()` to associate the name of the aesthetic with a variable to display. The `aes()` function gathers together each of the aesthetic mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer’s mapping argument. The syntax highlights a useful insight about x and y: the x and y locations of a point are themselves aesthetics, visual properties that you can map to variables to display information about the data.

Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.

You can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

Here, the color doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot. To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes outside of `aes()`. 

**IMPORTANT** - Take note of what goes inside or outside of `aes()` and what the corresponding effects are. Putting colour outside `aes()` and expecting the colors to map to some variable is a common rookie mistake.  

## Exercise: 

What has gone wrong with this code? Explain why the points in the following plot are not blue. 

```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

# Part 2: The layered grammar

Now you've seen some data visualizations made using ggplot2. Pretty neat, right?

But at this point, you might be very confused by the syntax, especially if you have seen some base R or lattice graphing functions. Other graphing systems often have specific function calls for specific types of graphs and takes a variety of inputs in order to tweak the corresponding details. 

In contrast, the power of ggplot2 lies in its layered grammar. Notice that the call to `ggplot2()` by itself doesn't produce a graph. It simply lays out a invisible canvas for subsequent "geoms" to be added to. In this way, new things are "layered" on top of each other to produce the final visualization. 

If you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2, read more [here](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)

## Basic concepts

**Layer**: The most important concept of ggplot2 is that graphics are built from different layers. This includes anything from the data used, the coordinate system, the axis labels, the plot’s title etc. This layered grammar is perhaps the most powerful feature of ggplot2. It allows one to build complex graphics by adding more and more layers to the basic graphics while each layer is simple enough to construct. Layers can contain one or more components such as data and aesthetic mapping, geometries, statistics, scaling etc. We will talk about some most common components next.

**Aesthetics**: They are graphic elements mapped to data defined by `aes()`. Some of the common aesthetics we usually define are: x-y positions, color, size, shape, linetype etc. Beginners are usually easily confused between aesthetics and geometries. An easy way to distinguish is that you are always trying to assign (map) data to some graphic elements in aesthetics, while in geometries you don’t feed in any information on the data. It will become clear with some examples later

**Geometries**: These are the actual graphic elements used to plot, like points / lines / bars etc. These functions usually start with `geom_` and their names are usually self-explanatory. You can also specify color and other graphic elements in these functions, but it will be a single value that’s applied to the entire data. Refer to [this reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-geoms) for a list of geoms available.

**Statistics**: These provide a simple and powerful way to summarize your data and present calculated statistics on the plot, like adding a regression line, a smoothed curve, calculating density curves etc. For a full list, see below. You can see some of the functions look very similar to some geom functions. Indeed these two categories are not mutually exclusive. Refer to [this reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-stats) for a list of available `stat` arguments.

**Scale**: Another powerful feature to alter the default scale to x-y axes, e.g. do a log transformation, instead of the traditional 2-step approach of transforming the data first and then plot it. You can also do more advanced customization to features like color, fill, etc. with these functions.  Refer to [this reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-scales) for a list of scale functions available.

**Additional layers**: Even more options are to add layers

  * [**Coordinate systems**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-coordinate-systems): define how x and y aesthetics combine to position elements in the plot
  
  * [**Facets**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-facetting): create multiple panels, each displaying subsets of the data
  
  * [**Guides**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-guides-axes-and-legends): additional control over axes and legends

### New template with more layers

Let's expand our horizons with a new template plotting function that includes more of these layers.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
    mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
    stat = <STAT>, 
    position = <POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <SCALE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION> +
  <AXIS_LABEL_FUNCTION>
```

Note that this template doesn't include every possible use case. But it does a pretty good job illustrating the structure of a typical ggplot call. Notice how things are "layered up"?

## How to use this template?

So far, you've seen the basic scatterplot with using `geom_point()` and `aes()` functionalities. Now, we will showcase a sample of the other functionalities so you have an idea of how to build more elaborate visualizations with the given template. 

## <GEOM_FUNCTION>

We can sub, or add in various geom functions.

### Adding a geom layer

As an example, let's add a smooth line (regression with loess) using `geom_smooth()` to our previous scatterplot of engine size against fuel efficiency.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Notice that `mapping = aes()` has been moved to the `ggplot()` call. This ensures that this argument is passed to all subsequent layers: `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` in this case. If you move the `aes()` argument in both layers separately, the result would be exactly the same. Try it! 

Aside: How should you decide whether to put your `mapping = aes()` call in `ggplot()` or in each layer? If you have multiple layers, and want the mappings to be the same for each layer, you can save some repetition by placing it in `ggplot()`. But, if your plot needs to use different mappings in some layers than others, you should place these mappings in each layer separately. 

### Other types of geoms

Now let's see what we can do with `geom_boxplot()`.

Lets use boxplots to examine highway fuel efficiency among the different vehicle types. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Here we go! Looks like pickup trucks and SUVs are the worse in terms of fuel efficiency. Makes sense? 

Note that we could have chosen to make a bar chart of the mean or median highway fuel efficiency in each class, but a boxplot is much more informative.  

There are many more types of geoms, some of which will be explored in part 3.

## <AXIS_LABEL_FUNCTION>

The axis labels are pretty ugly right now. Let's put in nicer look labels. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Highway Fuel Efficiency (miles per gallon)") +
  xlab("Vehicle Type")
```

## <SCALE_FUNCTION>

Let's plot the highway efficiency values on the log scale, just for fun. Do you notice what has changed?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Highway Fuel Efficiency (miles per gallon)") +
  xlab("Vehicle Type") +
  scale_y_log10()
```

## <COORDINATE_FUNCTION>

Let's add another "layer" to alter our coordinate system. By default, `coord_cartesian()` is used for `geom_point()` and `geom_bar()`. But we could flip the x and y axes, for example.

`coord_flip`? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Highway Fuel Efficiency (miles per gallon)") +
  xlab("Vehicle Type") +
  coord_flip()
```


## <FACET_FUNCTION> 

A facet allows you to render multiple panels at once, one for each class of a variable. 

To illustrate this functionality, lets go back to our original scatterplot. Now, you suspect that vehicle type (class) may complicate this relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency. So let's use `facet_wrap()` to split the vehicle types into different plots. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

There is also the `facet_grid()` function which can create facets based on more than one variable - read more [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#facets). 

# Part 3: Example gallery

We can combine various elements of geoms, aesthetics, facets, etc to produce a wide variety of plots. We have only scratched the surface. Here are a few more examples of different types of plots we might want to make. 

### Continuous variable as the third dimension

Lets color the data points by year. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Notice that ggplot makes a color gradient for showing the continuous variable year. Try a different variable, like `trans`. What happens?

### Combining facets and aesthetics

To illustrate other types of plots we might make, here are several examples.

A faceted plot with color aesthetics:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap( ~ year) +
  xlab("drivetrain type") +
  ylab("highway map")
```

### Histograms

To build a histogram, we use the `geom_histogram()` geom. Here is a histogram of highway mpg.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

### Density plots 

To build a density plot, we use the `geom_density()` geom. Here is a smoothed density plot of highway mpg.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + 
  geom_density()
```

Adding a 'rug' of data points at the bottom.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + 
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug()
```

Separate panels for different year of manufacture.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + 
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug() +
  facet_wrap( ~ year)
```

Or color by year.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy, color = year)) + 
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug()
```


# Part 4: Final notes and additional resources

**We have not covered all possible visualizations**. The purpose of this seminar was to introduce ggplot2 and to give you the tools to develop other visualizations that may come your way in the future. Arguably, the most important takeway of this seminar is the layered grammar of ggplot2. Once you understand the core structure of the ggplot2 setup, it will be easy to navigate and use the package's numerous elements in order to produce any desired outcome.

# Part 5: Deliverable

**To submit for credit**: To earn full marks for this seminar, do the following. Reproduce the visual below using the `mpg` dataset by adding your code below. Then add informative labels to the x and y axes, and replace the legend titles "drv" and "cyl" with more informative text (hint: check out the `labs()` function). So your final plot should look like the image below, but with more informative labels.
