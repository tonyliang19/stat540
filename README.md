## Prequisites and Resources

This interdisciplinary course requires a broad range of skills at the interfaceof statistics, molecular biology / genomics, and computing. While you may have some background in one or more of the following areas, you are not expected to be an expert in all.

### Statistics:

- Already taken a university level introductory statistics course.
- Reference for introduction or review of many statistical concepts relevant for the course: "[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/)" by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber.
- Reference for introduction or review and implementation of many statistical concepts in R: "[Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/)" by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love.

### Biology:

- No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like, e.g. the difference between DNA and RNA, and the difference between a gene and a genome.
- See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSqUDu4zb5k) and this [slideset](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/resources/blob/main/biology-intro-2017.pdf) for some basic introductory material. 
- Go through the (optional, not for a grade) molecular biology quiz on Canvas
- [This free online book "Concepts of Biology" by Fowler, Roush & Wise](https://openstax.org/books/concepts-biology/pages/1-introduction) is a great resource for biological concepts, in particular chapters 6 and 9
- [This free online book "Biology" by Clark, Douglas & Choi](https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/1-introduction) goes more in-depth, see Chapters 14, 15, and 16 for material on genetics that is particularly relevant for this course.
- No matter your prior experience, when you come across a new biological concept during the course or in your research, you might need to spend a bit of time 'learning as you go' - this is expected and something I still do regularly in my day-to-day research!

### R: 

- No experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven't taken other courses on R or used it in your research.
- Start now by installing [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integratrive.html).ed development cts/rstudio/downloaou are new to R, check out [this blog post on getting started with R](http://santina.me/Get-started-with-R/).
- [This free online resource with R, programming basics, and the tidyverse](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/)
  - [Chapter 2: R Basics](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html)
  - [Chapter 3: Programming Basics](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/programming-basics.h.io/dsbook/talab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html)
  
### Git/GitHub and R Markdown:

- In this course we'll be using the version conits web-based hosting awiki/GitHub). 
- [The online resource](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference for these tools as we learn them.
- Another helpful git resource is [Hadley Wickham's webinar "Collaboration and time travel- version control with git, github and RStudio"](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/collaboration-and-time-travel-version-control-with-git-github-an-rstudio/)
